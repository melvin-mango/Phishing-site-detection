# URL Phishing Detection using Decision Tree and Logistic Regression

## Overview

This project aims to classify URLs as either phishing websites or legitimate ones using machine learning techniques. Specifically, we use Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models to achieve this goal. The project also integrates Weights and Biases (wandb) for experiment tracking and visualization.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: The dataset used in this project is `urlset.csv`, which contains labeled URLs.
- **Models**: Two machine learning models are used: Decision Tree and Logistic Regression.
- **Weights and Biases Integration**: Experiment tracking and visualization are performed using wandb.

## Components

- **Data**: The `urlset.csv` dataset contains URLs labeled as phishing or not.
- **Decision Tree**: Implemented in `W&B Phishing Logistic Regression.ipynb` script.
- **Logistic Regression**: Implemented in `W&B Phishing Decision Trees.ipynb` script.
- **Weights and Biases**: Used for tracking experiments and visualizing results.

## Results

The results of the models, including performance metrics and visualizations, are logged to wandb. You can view the detailed results by visiting your wandb dashboard or checking the respective reports in the repository.
